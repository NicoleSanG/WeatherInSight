# WeatherInSight

This project is a web application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with current weather information and a 5-day forecast for a specified location. Key features include a clean display of current weather conditions, a forecast for the upcoming 5 days, and a convenient search history for quick access to past locations. The app is responsive and utilizes local storage to save search history between sessions.

Start your search by entering a location into the input box, then either press the 'enter' key or click the 'Search' button. This action will showcase the weather information for the current date and the next 5 days, and store your search in the history.

Should you click on any of the saved locations in your search history, it will refresh and present the current weather for the chosen location. To delete your search history, just click on the 'Clear Search' button.

If the location you are trying to search does not exist, you will see an alert with this text: "Location does not exist."
